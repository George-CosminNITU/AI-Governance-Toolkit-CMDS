# Corporate AI Governance & Acceptable Use Framework
**Student:** George-Cosmin NITU  
**Program:** CMDS 2025-2027  
**Semester 1 Deliverable (Feb 8, 2026)**

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a practical "AI Compliance Toolkit" designed to help organizations manage the security, legal, and operational risks associated with Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Gemini). It specifically addresses the rise of "Shadow AI" and the critical risk of sensitive corporate data leakage into public AI models.

## 2. State of the Art (SotA) Summary
### Regulatory Landscape
* **EU AI Act:** Imposes strict transparency and governance obligations for AI systems; non-compliance may result in heavy administrative fines.
* **GDPR:** Addresses the conflict between standard US-based AI contracts and European data residency/privacy requirements.
* **NIST AI RMF:** Utilized as the foundational technical standard for aligning corporate risk management with global best practices.

### Technical Analysis of AI Providers
* **Data Retention:** Research conducted on the data handling policies of OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google regarding corporate inputs and model training.
* **The Gap:** Current organizational responses are often limited to total bans (which are frequently bypassed) or zero policy. There is a verified lack of operational, "ready-to-deploy" checklists for IT Managers.

## 3. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) Skeleton
*The following structure represents the foundational design of the framework to be developed in Year 1, Semester 2:*

1. **Purpose & Scope:** Defining the legal and technical boundaries of AI tool usage.
2. **Roles & Responsibilities:** Outlining duties for HR, IT, and end-user compliance.
3. **Data Classification Standards:** Tiered definitions for Public, Internal, and Confidential data inputs.
4. **Approved vs. Prohibited Use Cases:** Clear guidelines on permissible data types for third-party AI assessment.
5. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Workflow:** Mandates for manual review of AI-generated output for accuracy and bias.

## 4. Roadmap (2025-2027)
* **Year 1, Semester 1 (Completed):** State of the Art research, technical analysis of major LLM providers, and AUP Skeleton design.
* **Year 1, Semester 2 (Upcoming):** Full development of the "Corporate AI Acceptable Use Policy" and Data Classification Guide.
* **Year 2, Semester 1:** Creation of the Excel-based Vendor Vetting Checklist and Risk Assessment Matrix.
* **Year 2, Semester 2:** Validation against real-world corporate scenarios and Final Master Thesis submission.
